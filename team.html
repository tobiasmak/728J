<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I'm Tobias (he/him/his) and when I'm not at work sorting through federal data or doing
 work for my MLIS I am fostering kittens! This website project was borne out of my desire to
  build something fun that I could spend some time enjoying myself on; and to consolidate my
   knowledge of resources in the DMV. </p>

<p>Since 2019, over 15 kittens have been fostered through my apartment, all of whom have found 
their forever home. I've really enjoyed building this project and hope it was interesting. </p>
