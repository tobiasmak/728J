Hello! :-)
My name is Toby and my pronouns are he/him/his. This is hopefully my last class in the iSchool for my Master's in Library and Information Science, where I've focused on inclusion and diversity and also legal informatics. I've taken several short 'coding for beginners' type classes both in school and for my own edification, and I'm taking this one again because much of it hasn't stuck around to the extent I'd like it to.

Outside of academics, I work as a content editor in an educational technology company working with government information. In my free time I foster kittens, cook, read, and (when not in quarantine/COVID-19 shutdown) participate in and train for contact sports. 
My favorite foods are dumplings, really fresh salmon, and beef tongue. 

I'm excited to learn a lot throughout this class!
