<h2>This seems kind of basic...</h2>

<p>It is! Specialty cases (such as medical intent) can require specific medications or care instructions, but in general
cats are pretty self sufficient. As long as they have food, water, a place to feel safe, and someone to share some love, a cat 
will thrive!</p>
	
<h3 class="question2">Is there a recommended type of litter or litterbox I should get?</h3>
<p>It depends on your preference. I use unscented clumping clay litter with odor control because I prefer scooping regularly 
over dumping the whole box weekly. Some people prefer walnut or sawdust or pellet litter. As long as you figure out a system 
and the cat doesn't have issues using it, use whatever you'd like! 

A litterbox should be at least 1.5 times the length of the cat so that it has enough room to fully turn around. It should be made out of a 
sanitizable material like hard plastic, not metal. Ideally you should give every cat at least two options on where to go to the bathroom,
but everyone's living space is a little different.</p>

<h3 class="question2">Is there a specific kind of food I should be getting?</h3>

<p>First check with your foster organization if they help you out with food costs at all! Sometimes an organization will give you a starter
kit of food and you can go from there. I feed my cats raw because I find it almost totally eliminates fecal odor and it's much healthier for them.
Most commercial foods, however, are carefully formulated with the animal's health in mind, and you will be able to feed your foster all recommended
nutrients with any cat specific food you find.</p>

<h3 class="question2">What do you mean by "dry, soft, enclosed space"?</h3>

<p>Cats like having privacy too! When you first bring your foster home it might feel scared or intimidated. Providing a box, shelter, hideaway, etc. 
helps them feel safer and more secure while adjusting to their new surroundings. Examples are a carrier, a cat bed, a cardboard box with a towel or 
soft pad in it, a cubby with a blanket.</p>

<h3 class="question2">Bottles?</h3>

<p>Kittens don't begin to eat solid food until their third week of life at the earliest! If you are matched with kittens who aren't weaned yet, they are called
"bottle babies" because they need to be fed regularly by you. Feeding kitten formula via baby bottle is one of the most efficient and safest ways to do this.</p>

<h3 class="question2">Heating pad?</h3>

<p>Similar to eating food, very young kittens don't produce their own body heat and are very delicate.  Putting a heating pad underneath their blankets is an
important part of kitten care. It helps regulate their environmental temperature, without which they can die.</p>

<h3 class="question2">Isolation? What's that about</h3>	

<p>When you first bring a foster home, it will take a while to get acclimated to your home. If you have resident animals, you will have to make sure that 
the fosters are quarantined from your other animals for at least 2 weeks. This allows the foster to adjust to the location, and is enough time for you to make sure 
that they are on any medication in case they are ill. It is ideal to keep fosters behind a double barrier - in a closed crate or playpen that is also in a room that
 can be closed or barricaded as well. </p>
