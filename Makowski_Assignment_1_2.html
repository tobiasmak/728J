 <h1>Hello :-)</h1>
 <p>My name is Toby and my pronouns are he/him/his. This is hopefully my last class in 
 the iSchool for my Master's in Library and Information Science, where I've focused on 
 inclusion and diversity and also legal informatics. I've taken several short 'coding for
 beginners' type classes both in school and for my own edification,  and I'm taking this 
 one again because much of it hasn't stuck around to the extent I'd like it to.</p>
 <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>
 <p>Outside of academics, I work as a content editor in an educational technology company
  working with government information. In my free time I foster kittens, cook, read, and 
  (when not in quarantine/COVID-19 shutdown) participate in and train for contact sports.
