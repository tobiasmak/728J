	<li class="question"> What is fostering?</li>
		<p>Fostering an animal is agreeing to take it into your home and caring for it 
		as though it were your own for either an agreed upon period of time or until it 
		is adopted.  </p>
	<li class="question"> Are there different types of fostering?</li>
		<p><a href="types.html">Yes!</a></p>
	<li class="question"> Why is fostering important? </li>
		<p>If youâ€™re interested in helping out in animal rescue, fostering can be a great
		 option! By taking an animal into your home you are helping reduce overcrowding at
		  shelters and opening up that bed for another animal in need. It can also be a 
		  lifesaver for animals who need specialized medical care hat a shelter might not 
		  be equipped or prepared to take on. </p>
	<li class="question"> What kind of time commitment is fostering?</li>
		<p>Fostering an animal is exactly like having your own pet! It depends on the animal. Fostering animals
			with medical needs like requiring bottle feeding, medication, bite alerts, or chronic illnesses might require higher attention levels
			and time committments to care. Fostering healthy animals that have psychological needs similarly might be a longer endeavor than expected.
