<h2>This file is going to be about my current foster kittens</h2>

<div>
<p>This is a list of the current foster cats I have in my house <i>right now</i>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Raspberry</li>
		<ul>
        <li>A 10 month old tuxedo female</li>
        </ul>
	<li>Haagen Dazs, "Haag"</li>
		<ul>
        <li>10 week old black and white female who loves to eat human food</ul>
        </li>
	<li>Gelato</li>
		<ul>
        <li>10 week old black and white female who likes stretching out in doorways and falling asleep</li>
        </ul>
	<li>Froyo</li>
		<ul><li>10 week old black and white cape female, spicy, loves cuddling and growling when displeased</li></ul>
	<li> and Sorbet</li>
		<ul><li>10 week old black female who at one point weighed 3x more than her littermates and who likes to be lazy</li></ul>
</ul>

<p>This litter is collectively called the <strong><u>Cow Cats</u></strong>, because they are all, with the 
exception of Sorbet, black and white cats. This coat pattern reminds me of cows, so I call them cow cats. That's also why 
they all have dairy names.</p>

<p>They are all girls and have recently all been spayed, and they are kittens fifteen through nineteen
that have gone through our house.</p>
